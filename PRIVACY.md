# Privacy Policy for Speech Practice

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

## Overview

Speech Practice is a speech rehearsal app that helps you practice reading text aloud. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains what data the app collects and how it is used.

## Data Collection

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

- **Speech text**: The speeches you create are stored locally on your device using iOS data storage. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to use cloud text-to-speech services.
- **Playback settings**: Your preferences (speech rate, pause settings, voice selections) are stored locally on your device.
- **Azure API credentials**: If you choose to use Microsoft Azure text-to-speech, your API key is stored securely in your device's Keychain. This credential is only used to authenticate with Microsoft's servers.

### Data Sent to Third-Party Services

The app offers optional cloud-based text-to-speech services:

1. **Microsoft Azure Text-to-Speech** (optional)
   - When enabled, your speech text is sent to Microsoft Azure servers for voice synthesis.
   - Requires your own Azure API key.
   - Microsoft's privacy policy applies: https://privacy.microsoft.com/

2. **TartuNLP** (Estonian language)
   - When practicing Estonian speeches, text may be sent to TartuNLP servers for voice synthesis.
   - TartuNLP is a free academic service from the University of Tartu.
   - No account or API key required.

### Data We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect personal information.
- We do not track your usage or behavior.
- We do not use analytics services.
- We do not display advertisements.
- We do not share any data with third parties for marketing purposes.

## Offline Mode

When using the iOS (Offline) voice option, all text-to-speech processing happens entirely on your device. No data is transmitted to any server.

## Data Security

- All local data is protected by iOS security features.
- API credentials are stored in the iOS Keychain, which provides hardware-backed encryption.
- Network requests to cloud services use HTTPS encryption.

## Children's Privacy

This app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app stores data locally and does not require account creation.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device:
- You can delete any speech by removing it within the app.
- You can clear all app data by deleting and reinstalling the app.
- You can remove Azure credentials in the app settings.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
